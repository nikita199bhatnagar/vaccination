Unknowns
How do I find my latitude and longitude
How do I get vaccination centre data
How do I calculate the distance
How do I show the information to the client

Tasks List
1. Show my current loctaion a webpage 
2. Calculate distance from a particular location



We need to show the pincode and also include the distance in the report 
So that we can sort on the distance 
Also district name will be good as a column 
Ideally having a drop down to select the district




  <!-- <div id="nearby-covid-places-mapmyindia">
    <script type="text/javascript">
        loadNearbyCovidCentresMapmyIndiaDiv(document.getElementById("nearby-covid-places-mapmyindia"));
    </script>
    </div> -->


It's not mobile compatible that's the one issue I see
Colours need to change to a lighter background and mellow colours as well else older people won't be able to see clearly
Overall it's a simple design and if you are going against information display as a primary output this does the job
But you need to roll it out quickly and publish it on LinkedIn
